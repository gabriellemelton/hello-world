# hello-world
From the GitHub Guide

My name is Gabrielle and I am learning how to use GitHub and how to code. My reason for doing so is to keep up with the ever evolving job market and make myself more marketable.

I have three cats and a dog. Their names are Alibi, Felony, Atty (short for Attorney), and Witness, respectively.
